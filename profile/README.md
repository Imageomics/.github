# Imageomics: Bringing machine learning to life.

The Imageomics Institute GitHub organization hosts the development and distribution of a collection of open-source ML tools used to study the biological information encoded in images and videos integrated with structured biological knowledge.  

**Imageomics = the 'omics' of images, or the study of the totality of biological information able to be computationally extracted from images.**
